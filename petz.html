  <h1>My quick brown fox jumps over my lazy dog</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>The rest of my animals laugh</li>
      <li>Rudolf thinks the dog is lame</li>
      <li>The pet moles just undermine the fox's points</li>

    <h3>Story time</h3>
    <p>A couple was once driving down a dusty road. They hit a rabbit. The bunny was clearly deceased. It was sad. </p>
    <p>After staring at the poor animal for a time they went to the trunk of the car and got a spray can.</p>
    <p>They sprayed the rabbit and it slowly began to re-inflate and hop back to life.</p>
    <p>Confused, nearby onlookers asked what was in the can.</p>
    <p><strong>They responded plainly, "hair restorer"</strong></p>
